# PincherX_PickPlace_Package
PincherX_PickPlace_Package is a pipeline designed to detect objects, pick them up, and place them in specified positions using a 4DOF Arbotic Pincher X Manipulator arm. This package is entirely coded from scratch without using high-level libraries.

Work Under Progress...

This project is part of Robotics Lab Spring 2025.
